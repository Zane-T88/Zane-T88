# Welcome

I'm a coder with a physics background, focused on building useful, real-world tools. My work blends automation, data handling, and simple UI/UX in Python.

This GitHub is a growing portfolio of focused, problem-solving projects â€” each built from scratch, explained, and polished for actual use.
